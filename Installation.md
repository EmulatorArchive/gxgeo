## Installation ##
  * Download the [latest version](http://code.google.com/p/gxgeo/downloads/list) of GxGeo
  * Extract the zip on to your SD card. The romrc contains information about ROM sets, if you only put the .rc files for the ROMs you have in that folder gxgeo will load faster :)
  * Your ROMs (zipped up) and BIOS files should go in /sd/gxgeo/roms
